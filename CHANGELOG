2014-09-03  Bryce Boe <bboe@cs.ucsb.edu>
   - Add license notice

2014-09-02 Foivos S. Zakkak <foivos@zakkak.net>
   - Fixed Feature macros
   - Check for proper values in LIMITS
   - Use only tar (czf) for both the archiving and the compression
     Now, it works something like this:
     su user tar czf - assignment | su class tee ~class/TURNIN/as1 > /dev/null
   - Write directly to the destination, don't use temp files and then move.
     This comes at the cost of possible left overs in a case of a fail.
   - Since the tar command is run by the user and not the class or the root
     it can only access and archive files readable by the user.  That means
     we don't need to check about these files.  We can let linux do all the
     permission checking for us.  Under the same spirit we do not need to
     worry about absolute and relative paths including ".." (CAUTION: this is
     only regarding files to be turned in and not the assignment path under
     TURNIN or the class name)
     As a result check_symlinks is no longer needed.
   - Introduce strict checks for file-paths for the assignment

2014-09-01 Foivos S. Zakkak <foivos@zakkak.net>
   - Recursively check symlinks to get to the actual file
   - Reduced use of strcpy
   - Reduced attack surface
   - Ignore signals at the beginning (can't get interrupted while privileged)
   - Files renamed to *.tgz not *.tar.Z anymore
   - Some comments
   - isbinaryfile only checks for 0 since 0x80 results in false positives in
     unicode
   - Removed EQS define
   - Rename shufflenames to movetar
   - Add return type in functions
   - Remove unused variables
   - Fix Makefile

2013-02-15  Bryce Boe <bboe@cs.ucsb.edu>
   - Check for EOF on input prompts to fix 100% CPU zombie processes bug
   - Reuse `wanttocontinue` for "already submitted prompt"

2010-11-04  Bryce Boe <bboe@cs.ucsb.edu>

   - Also added exit(1) for user aborted exits.
